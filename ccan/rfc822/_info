/**
 * rfc822 - Parsing of RFC822 emails
 *
 * This code allows easy processing of RFC822/RFC2822/RFC5322
 * formatted email messages.  For now only read-only operation is
 * supported.
 *
 * The important design goals are these:
 * - Be lazy.  Don't compute immediately compute fancy indexes for the
 *   message.  Just reading messages into the system and then sending
 *   them out again should not incur a serious performance hit.
 * - But cache.  Once the user does request data that needs parsing,
 *   cache the results in suitable data structures so that if lots
 *   more lookups are done they're then fast.
 * - Cope with ill-formatted messages.  Even if the input is not
 *   RFC822 compliant, don't SEGV and try to return as much useful
 *   data as possible.
 *
 * Example:
 *	char buf[] = "From: <from@example.com>\n"
 *		     "To: <to@example.com>\n\n"
 *                   "body\n";
 *	struct rfc822_msg *msg;
 *	struct bytestring body;
 *
 *	msg = rfc822_start(NULL, buf, sizeof(buf));
 *	body = rfc822_body(msg);
 *	fwrite(body.ptr, 1, body.len, stdout);
